# MathsPart2

A Command Line Game App 'MathsPart2' that generates a random mathematical question (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication & Division).
It reports play time for each question and total play time for the user, then, it reports the average time it takes the player to answer a question.  

This application uses factory pattern to randomly generate and return an instance of 1 of the 4 subclasses of math questions.
It also demonstrates the use of 'Polymorphism" that Main.m will access everything it needs from properties and methods on the superclass.
